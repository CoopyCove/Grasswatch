The care and upkeep of lawns is something countless households struggle with due to numerous issues. We seek to make the maintenance of ones lawn easier
- Heat, dryness, watering, grass length are issues lawn owners deal with
- After surveying lawn owners, we learned that many are concerned about the general appearance of their lawn.
- When polled about what aspect of their lawn is important to them, 60% responded that presentation was a big concern. 
- We aim to create a service that can notify and consistently update the user on concerns regarding their lawn and actions that should be taken. 
- Focused primarily on Neural Networks and Machine Learning algorithms that operate on visual input
